# Lambda-Practice


I've utilized java lambda in the past but it wasn't ever anything touched on in school. Only in professional environments did begin to see it.
This repo serves as a place where I store my practice problems so I can get a deeper understanding of lambda. This code is very simple, just junit tests, the main class is a list of problems given here https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/lambda/index.php
